# Geocoder index smoke tests.
#
# Each test searches the index for an address and verifies that the
# returned coordinates are within `tolerance` degrees of the expected
# values. The default tolerance (~0.01 degrees ~ 1.1 km) can be
# overridden per test.
#
# All tests must pass. If a test fails because the address is not in
# the current data set, update or remove the entry.
